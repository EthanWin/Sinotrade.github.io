Futures [ \"TXFC0\" ], quote_type = \"tick\" ) Subscribe the real time market data. Simplely pass contract into quote subscribe function and give the quote type will receive the streaming data. Quote Type Currently we support two quote type you can see in shioaji . constent . QuoteType . The best way to use that is directly pass this enum into subscribe function.

Pass them into place_order function, then it will return the trade that describe the status of your order. Conclusion \u00b6 This quickstart demonstrates how easy to use our package for native Python users. Unlike many other trading API is hard for Python developer. We focus on making more pythonic trading API for our users.","title":"Quick Start"},{"location":"quickstart/#initialization","text":"import shioaji as sj api = sj .
